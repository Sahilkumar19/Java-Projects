Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing is a paradigm that provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet. It includes various service models like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS offers virtualized computing resources, while PaaS provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications. SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installations.

Cloud computing also involves deployment models, such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Public clouds are owned by third-party providers and open for public use, while private clouds are dedicated to a single organization. Hybrid clouds combine elements of both public and private clouds, offering flexibility and scalability.
