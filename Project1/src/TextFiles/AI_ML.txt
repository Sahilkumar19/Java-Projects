Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing the way computers process information and make decisions. ML enables systems to learn from data and improve performance over time. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning employs a reward system for decision-making.

AI encompasses broader capabilities, including problem-solving, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, play a crucial role in AI, especially in deep learning applications. The fusion of ML and AI is driving innovations in fields such as image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics.
